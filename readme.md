# Java Calculator.
*NOT A COMPLETED PROJECTED, CHECK FOR ISSUES

Complete Calculator Program in Java Including GUI.

## Problem Statement.


Using all the Java constructs/building blocks you have learnt, design and develop a GUI based scientific multi-mode multi-typed calculator to support: 

• Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder)

• Percentage, exponential, degrees, and radians operators

• Trigonometric, hyperbolic, and log functions.

### Note That:

1. Being a multi-typed calculator, it allows to select any numeric (integer and real) data types for input/output.

2. The default number system of the calculator should be decimal, however, being a multi-mode calculator, it allows unsigned integers any of the four number systems (binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal) only for arithmetic operations.
